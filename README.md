# FCFS-Scheduling
This program shows the performance of FCFS scheduling algorithm with I/O burst.
The program gets a file (e.g., “jobs.txt”) via command-line input. This "jobs.txt" file contains a set of processes.
The general format of a line is as follows:
<process-id>:(< cpu-burst1, io-burst1>);(< cpu-burst2, io-burst2>);...(< cpu-bursti, io-bursti>)
