# FCFS-Scheduling
## This program shows the performance of FCFS scheduling algorithm with I/O burst.<br/>
### The program gets a file (e.g., “jobs.txt”) via command-line input.<br/>This "jobs.txt" file contains a set of processes.<br/>The general format of a line is as follows:<br/>\<process-id>:(< cpu-burst1, io-burst1>);(< cpu-burst2, io-burst2>);...(< cpu-bursti, io-bursti>)
